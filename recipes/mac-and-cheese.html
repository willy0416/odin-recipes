    <h2>Crispy and gooey goodness made in just one pan</h2>
    <p>Thinking about what to make for a potluck or for Thanksgiving dinner? Fear not - we've got you covered. Cook this twist on a classic and your tummy will thank you.</p>
    <p>With only five minutes of prep time and twenty minutes of cook time, you can step away from the kitchen and enjoy whatever else you like while this baby broils. Feel free to substitute margarine with butter, as well.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>16 ounces uncooked elbow macaroni</li>
        <li>2.5 cups milk</li>
        <li>2 cups water</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li><em>1/4 cup margarine</em></li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1.5 cups shredded white Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 cup shredded Parmesan cheese, divided</li>
        <li>1/4 cup panko bread crumbs</li>
        <li>1/4 cup <strong>real</strong> bacon bits</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon snipped chives</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine macaroni, milk, water, garlic salt, and salt in a Dutch oven on a stovetop over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Bring to a boil, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to a simmer and cook, stirring frequently so noodles don't stick to the pan, until noodles are soft and most of the liquid has been absorbed, 7 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove pot from heat and stir in margarine and pepper until melted. Stir in Cheddar cheese and 1/4 cup of the Parmesan cheese until melted.</li>
        <li>Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.</li>
        <li>Top pasta with bread crumbs, remaining 1/4 cup of Parmesan cheese, and bacon bits.</li>
        <li>Place Dutch oven under the broiler until topping is lightly browned and crispy, 1 to 3 minutes. Top with chives and serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
